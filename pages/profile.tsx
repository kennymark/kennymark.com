            Iâ€™m Kenny Coffie, currently a Software Engineer for Evergreen Health. I am primarily a
            front-end focused developer who can do full stack when needed. With a total of 5 years
            of experience, 3 years freelancing, studying and building hobby projects and {exp} years
            commercial I have worked on every kind of application be it small, medium or very large
            enterprise application. I love everything UI and UX on the web but I have also worked on
            developed mobile applications, web apps and some backend applications.

            I actively spend many hours per day working on my side projects which can be found on
            <span>
              <Link isExternal href='https://github.com/kennymark'>
                github
              </Link>
            </span>
            . Software development aside, I am also heavily invested in the creation and nurturing
            of ideas that are used by the masses. I incline to be entrepreneurial at times and
            product design would be an area I would love to explore and competent at. I see beyond
            code and design.
