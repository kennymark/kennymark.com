            Iâ€™m Kenny Coffie, currently a Software Engineer for Evergreen Health. I am front-end focused developer with full stack experience. With a total of 5 years of experience, 3 years freelancing, studying and building hobby projects and 2 years commercial I have worked on every kind of application be it small, medium or very large enterprise application. I love everything UI and UX on the web but I have also worked on developed mobile applications, web apps and some backend applications.

          <chakra.p> I actively spend many hours per day working on my side projects which can be found on
          <span>
              <Link isExternal href="https://github.com/kennymark">github</Link>
            </span>. Software development aside, I am also heavily invested in the creation and nurturing of ideas that are used by the masses. I incline to be entrepreneurial at times and product design would be an area I would love to explore and competent at. I see beyond code and design.
