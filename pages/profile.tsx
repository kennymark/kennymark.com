            Iâ€™m Kenny Coffie, currently a Software Engineer for Evergreen Health. I am primarily a
            front-end focused developer with fullstack skills. With a total of 5 years of
            experience, 3 years freelancing, studying and building hobby projects and {exp} years
            commercial I have worked on every kind of application from small, medium to very
            large/bloated enterprise applications. I love everything UI and UX on the web but I have
            also worked and developed mobile applications and desktop applications.
